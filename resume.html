        <div class="about_text">
          <p>I’m relatively young in terms of development experience but seasoned in designing systems and collaborating with diverse teams. My development experience is primarily in Front End: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I use SASS(SCSS), Grunt and git in my workflow. I am constantly working to develop my depth of knowledge in CS fundamentals as well as learning new tools and languages. I write understandable, modular code and try to ensure the user has a valuable and positive experience.</p>
          <p>I’m currently looking to join a team where I can contribute, grow and accelerate my learning. My primary interest is in UI & Front End development but I am also interested in exploring other parts of the stack. </p>
