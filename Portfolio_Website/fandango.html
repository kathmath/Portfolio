              <h4>Project Brief:</h4>
              Fandango wants to expand their market from movies into to concerts and local events. We designed a service that notifies users of events happening in their area,allows them to purchase tickets and use digital passes to attend events.

              <h4>Role:</h4>
              This was a collaborative effort between Stephanie Cruz, Sapna Thakur and myself. I identified user needs and created personas, developed and prioritized features, developed information architecture and user flows, made and tested prototypes. Created as a 2 week student project at General Assemblyâ€™s UXDi.

            <div class = "challenges">
              <h4>Challenges:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>cater to diverse user base</li>
                <li>integrate into existing app or develop an app that provides continuity of experience with existing app and website</li>
                <li>provide variety of content without overwhelming users</li>
              </ul>     
            </div>  
          </div>
          <div class = "projectSection">
            <h4>Research:</h4>
            <div class = "projectText">
              <p> We identified services that provide event discovery and/or ticket purchasing and evaluated their features to see what value they offer.</p>
              <p>I surveyed and interviewed users about how they find events, purchase tickets and how they feel about making mobile purchases and identified opportunities by evaluating competing services.</p>

              <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>people approach discovering events very differently than movies</li>
                  <li>people use many sources for discovery, then purchase tickets from different sources</li>
                  <li>digital passes are convenient but people have had negative experiences</li>
                  <li>mobile purchases can be clumsy and people are concerned about security</li>
                  <li>recommending events that are relevant to the user is important because people often feel bombarded with options</li>
                  <li>people want to know what events their friends are attending and to share events with friends</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Persona Development & Definition of Features</h4>
            <div class = "projectText">
               <p>We defined four personas and developed scenarios in which they would need to find events and use tickets. We used these scenarios to find the key functionality required to reach their goals and mapped these out in terms of priority and effort to determine essential features to reach their goals.</p>
                <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>ability to browse freely or filter</li>
                  <li>purchase tickets and use digital pass to attend events</li>
                  <li>provide recommendations based on the preferences</li>
                  <li>share events with friends and see what events friends are attending</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Design Development</h4>
            <div class = "projectText">
              <p> After preliminary sketching and ideation, I focused on developing user flows based on the most common scenarios defined for our personas. We took in to consideration Fandango's existing movie app and where it made sense we used its design conventions to keep a consistent experience across the brand. I designed the information architecture based on the user flows while my team started wireframing and prototyping. We did a round of quick paper prototypes that we tested and then made a digital prototype.</p>
              
              <h4>Key Findings:</h4> 
              <ul>
                 <li>add search field to more screens</li>
                 <li>people like variety of ways to discover new events</li>
                 <li>bring bookmarks and tickets to navigation toolbar for quick and easy access</li>
                 <li>add more comprehensive filtering options</li>
                 <li>consistency in layout (navigation toolbar, etc.)</li> 
                 <li>clarify terminology</li>
                 <li>use more relevant icons</li>
